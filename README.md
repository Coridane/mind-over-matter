# mind-over-matter

## Description
This web application provides a place where people can learn more about different learning
disabilities, donate to worthy charities, and play a game that helps with focus and memory.
## User Story
As a User, I want to be able to go to a site that provides excellent information on autism through
links that are already available online so that I can better understand the challenges that those
folks go through. I want a site that is secure, so a login with a password is needed for
authentication. Once inside the site, I can donate to charities that are popular on the Internet
safely and securely. Finally, if a family member wishes to practice a memory game, he or she
can do so. The game involves matching image pairs and/or images to words with sounds for
learning. The highest scores with the option to clear stats will be available. Badges can also be
won for those who practice hard.
